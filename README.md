# Next.js Ecommerce Website 🛒

#### Project Goal ✨

The reason I chose this project was because in the past I had designed and worked with a developement team in order to bring my marketplace startup idea to life. Now I want to understand how everything works in order to create an e-commerce website, how to work with a headless CMS like Strapi and how to handle payments using Stripe!

E-commerce is at the heart of the web, and so I think it is super important to have a good understanding of how to build a project like this. Also, it's highly likely that any potential web devlopement work I will do in the future will include managing products, payments, etc ...
